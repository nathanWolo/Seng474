All the code should work independently, the only requirement is that you have recent versions of the following packages installed:
    - numpy
    - scikit-learn
    - matplotlib
    - pandas

The code is written to run in python 3.10.0, but should work with any maintained versions (3.8+)

A requirement for the data fetching code to work is that the fashion-mnist repo is cloned into the code directory (ie the parent directory of all the actual python files)

The experiments were written as functions, to re-run the experiments and reproduce my plots - simply uncommment the function calls to 
the experiments you wish to run.
