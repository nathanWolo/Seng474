Everything should work, its fairly self contained. 

To run the lloyds experiments, just run the lloyds.py file.

to run the hac experiments, run the hac.py file.

For stuff to work, the data needs to be in the parent directory of utils.py
so the get_data function can find it. Its all fairly self contained, 
any recent version of python + numpy + scipy should work.

Theres a ton of extra figures in clustering_algos/figs if you want to see the result of
every experiment, but the samples in the report should be adequate.
