Instructions for running code:

Everything is written in python, you will need the libraries that are imported
at the top of each file to run the experiments.

Each experiment was written as a function, and you can run it by uncommenting 
the function call responsible for it, and running the file
You will also need to have training data (cleaned_adult.csv) in the same directory
as the code folders.
example:

uncomment lr_test() and run python neural_network.py in your shell, and the function
will save a plot of the experiment as a png file.
