Title:
ReLUno


2-3 sentence description:
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has seen a renaissance in the recent era of deep learning, with research labs like DeepMind (Go, Chess) and OpenAI ( DOTA) seeing great success in applying RL algorithms to games with the help of deep NNs. Uno is a popular card game with simple rules, but a deep state space (napkin math says over 2^200 states), a great testbed for applying deep RL. The project could benchmark several different RL algorithms (e.g policy gradient, Q learning, random policy) against each other to see which is best suited for the game in terms of episodes until convergence or overall quality of play.
